# 71. Simplify Path
# Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.
#
# In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..' refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as file/directory names.
#
# The canonical path should have the following format:
#
# The path starts with a single slash '/'.
# Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
# The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
# The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
# Return the simplified canonical path.

# 791. Custom Sort String
# You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously.
#
# Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted. More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order, then x should occur before y in the permuted string.
#
# Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.

            if c in count:

# 249. Group Shifted Strings
# We can shift a string by shifting each of its letters to its successive letter.
#
# For example, "abc" can be shifted to be "bcd".
# We can keep shifting the string to form a sequence.
#
# For example, we can keep shifting "abc" to form the sequence: "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz".
# Given an array of strings strings, group all strings[i] that belong to the same shifting sequence. You may return the answer in any order.

    def groupStrings(self, strings: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:

            for i in range(len(s) - 1):
                circular_difference = 26 + ord(s[i + 1]) - ord(s[i])
